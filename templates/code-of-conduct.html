        <h1>Hackathon Code of Conduct</h1>
        <p class="mt-2">At Code Institute, our hackathons are fast-moving, collaborative events that thrive on active
            participation and teamwork. They provide exciting opportunities to learn and innovate, but the pace can be
            intense. We encourage participants to consider whether this environment aligns with their personal
            preferences and availability. Ensuring you're comfortable with the demands of the event will help you and
            your team make the most of the experience, while maintaining a mindful approach to your well-being and that
            of others.</p>

        <ol class="text-left">
            <li>Be respectful and inclusive towards all other participants, facilitators, Hackteam, Staff or anyone else
                involved in the hackathon. Discriminatory language or behavior of any kind is not allowed.
            </li>
            <li>Only register if you can commit a minimum of 3 hours a day.</li>
            <li>Keep in contact with your team. All project discussions should take place within the dedicated team
                Slack Channel. This way, our Hackathon Facilitators and Staff can stay up to date on your progress and
                offer support when needed. We want to make sure that everyone on the team is aware of all goings-on.
            </li>
            <li>We want to ensure that everyone on the team has a chance to participate and add their unique skills and
                perspectives. Let's work together to make sure everyone is included and valued. More experienced team
                members should keep in mind that some members may be less experienced, and may need extra support and
                guidance. By offering more time and assistance to those who may need it, we can ensure that everyone has
                an opportunity to grow their skills and contribute to the project. Remember, this is a team effort and
                we want to work together to achieve our goals rather than rushing ahead.
            </li>
            <li>If you need to drop off from the event before it ends, you must inform your team and the team
                facilitator. If you drop off without informing your team, you will be ineligible to participate in the
                next hackathon.
            </li>
            <li>If you witness or experience any behavior that violates this code of conduct, please report it
                immediately to your facilitator, the HackTeam or the Code Institute Community Team.</li>   

        </ol>
